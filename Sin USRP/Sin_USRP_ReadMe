Basic USRP Rx / Tx Test - Hunter G. Cook September 2022 - huntergcook@gatech.edu

USRP_RX:
	-try release for running multiple times.(Release object before next run)
	-Basic Comm paramameters set as beginning(Fc,Gain,SamplesPerFrame,TimePerFrame)
		Mostly adhoc for demonstration purposes, feel free to explore these values.
		call_uhd_app('benchmark_rate','--tx_rate 20e6','-echo'); in MATLAB
		adjusted the TX rate until there were no overflows and used that value for Fs
	-comm.SDRuReceiver sets up system RX object. (See USRP manual for MATLAB)
		Radio0 a.k.a 316405A will be the recieving radio.
		It will receive on the RX2 port of RF0
		I have a 10mhz referenece clock and PPS source connected to the radio.
	-Reception (See USRP manual for MATLAB)
		General gist is to keep trying to recieve until the radio give us a vector
		set length to zero before doing this so we know that we got good data
	-FFT for analyses
		100Khz spike right where we expect.



USRP_TX:
	-Matching parameters to RX
		Gain is important, Wired medium means easy to clip.
		Side/unexpected lobes on FFT probably mean clipping.
	-comm.SDRuTransmitter sets up system TX object (See USRP manual for MATLAB)
		Radio1 a.k.a 316407B will be the transmitting radio.
		It will transmit from the TX1/RX1 port of RF0
		I have a 10mhz referenece clock and PPS source connected to the radio.
	-SinGen: 100khz sin wave with Fs and Frame length accounted for
	-Continually transmit the same data
		More complex transmissions will not be this simple (i.e. Modulated Data)
		i keeps track and makes sure things are working

NOTES:
Both radios taking 10MHZ reference signal and Pulse Per Second from external clock generator. Radios connected via wired medium. Radios connected to PC via USB3.0 cables in seperate ports.

Scripts NEED to be ran in different MATLAB terminals to execute in paralell.
